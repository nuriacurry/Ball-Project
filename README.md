# Unity Ball Collision Lab

## Overview
Unity 2D ball physics simulation with collision counting and game termination.

## Features
- ✅ Ball spawns at position (2,0) with 2x scale
- ✅ Random force applied for movement
- ✅ Collision counter tracks bounces
- ✅ Game stops after 20 collisions
- ✅ Ball object destroyed at 20 collisions
- ✅ Debug messages show collision count

## Scripts
- **Ball.cs** - Main ball behavior and collision handling
- **Timer.cs** - Timer utility class  
- **Test Timer.cs** - Timer testing script

## How to Run
1. Open Unity project
2. Press Play
3. Watch ball bounce and collision counter in Console
4. Game automatically stops after 20 collisions

## Lab Tasks Completed
1. ✅ Stop game after 20 collisions
2. ✅ Destroy ball object after 20 collisions with message
